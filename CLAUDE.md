# Project History

A running log of architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them, kept
so future work (by anyone, human or Claude) doesn't have to rediscover the
same trade-offs. Newest entry on top. Don't rewrite old entries when they're
superseded — add a new entry and note what changed and why; the old entry
stays as the record of what was true and decided at the time.

## 2026-07-17 — Live tool-dispatch + security test coverage

**Decision:** Add `tests/live_db/test_tool_dispatch_{reads,writes,security}.py`
— the first tests to exercise the *entire* real dispatch chain
(`execute_tool()` → `/voice/tools/{name}` route → `safety_layer`
authz/constraints → `queries.py`) against real Neon-shaped data, calling
`execute_tool()` directly (the exact function OpenAI's MCP path calls) with
no mocking. 24 new tests: 5 read-tool, 7 write-tool, 12 security (token
integrity, cross-shop authz, phone-mismatch authz, lead-time/past-slot
constraints, unknown-tool-name rejection, malformed/missing-field input,
and the two independently-violable FK scenarios — nonexistent `customer_id`
and nonexistent `staff_id` — each asserted separately).

**Why this gap existed:** `tests/voice_gateway/test_voice_tools_*.py` covers
the route handlers but mocks every DB call; `tests/live_db/*.py` covers the
query layer but calls it directly, below the authz layer. Nothing exercised
`safety_layer`'s authz/constraint logic against a real row or the real
schema — a regression there (e.g. `modify_booking` silently dropping its
phone check) would have passed every existing test. Verified this class of
regression actually gets caught: manually removed the phone-mismatch check
in `booking_authz.py` and confirmed (via a monkeypatch-driven simulation of
the full dispatch path, since the QA branch currently lacks seed data —
see below) that execution then proceeds past the point it should have been
rejected, then restored the check.

**A real production bug was found and fixed along the way, not just a test
gap:** while strengthening a security test for malformed input, discovered
that `create_booking` with a syntactically valid but nonexistent
`customer_id` crashed `execute_tool()` itself with an unhandled
`asyncpg.exceptions.ForeignKeyViolationError`, instead of returning a clean
error — because `insert_booking_locked`
(`booking_engine/db/voice_tool_queries.py`) only caught `SlotConflictError`,
never a customer/staff FK violation from the underlying raw INSERT in
`booking_engine/db/queries.py::create_appointment`. Fixed by catching
`asyncpg.exceptions.ForeignKeyViolationError` alongside the existing
`SlotConflictError` catch, distinguishing `invalid_staff` vs
`invalid_customer` via the exception's `constraint_name` (since both
columns are independently-violable FKs and only `service_id` was already
pre-validated before this call). A stale or hallucinated `customer_id`
reaching this path in production — plausible, since OpenAI supplies tool
arguments — would have crashed a live call's tool invocation before this
fix. Checked the sibling `webapp` repo's own booking-creation code
(`src/lib/db/repositories/appointments.repo.ts`) for the same bug class:
it does NOT share this crash risk — its callers wrap the insert in a
generic catch-all that degrades to a clean 500 (less precise error
messaging, but no crash), and its agent-facing path additionally
pre-validates `customer_id`/`staff_id`/`service_id` against the shop before
ever attempting the insert.

**Two things discovered while writing these tests, worth knowing:**
- `modify_booking`/`cancel_booking` authorize off the **call row's stored
  `shop_id`** (read back via `get_call()`), not the `X-Shop-Id` header the
  MCP dispatch layer sends — cross-shop tests have to insert the call
  itself under the wrong shop, a header alone doesn't reach this check.
- `update_customer_from_call` (`booking_engine/api/routes/voice_tools_identity.py`)
  has **no shop-ownership check at all** — any valid call token can update
  any customer row's `email`/`tags` regardless of which shop the call
  belongs to. Not fixed here (out of scope for a test-coverage plan —
  changing production authz logic is a different, riskier kind of change
  than the narrow FK-crash fix above, which was pure error-handling, not a
  policy decision); flagged as a fast-follow.

**Also flagged, not actioned:** `voice_gateway/` (the old 5-tool, no-authz
agent implementation) is dead code — neither `fly.toml` nor `fly.qa.toml`
build it, only `booking_engine/Dockerfile.fly`. It's still imported by ~6
test files (`tests/voice_gateway/test_call_lifecycle.py`,
`test_db.py`, `test_booking_client.py`, `test_openai_classifier.py`,
`test_realtime_lifecycle.py`, `tests/live_db/test_voice_gateway_persistence.py`),
and the CI workflow files that reference it are the ones another concurrent
effort (the ephemeral-branch-CI spec) is already modifying — deleting it is
a separate follow-up, not part of this work.

**Still needed before this closes the loop end-to-end:** the ephemeral-branch
CI pipeline (separate, in-flight effort — as of this writing, memory records
it's fixed and PR #4 is open into QA, not yet merged) needs to run these
tests in CI. As of this writing the QA Neon branch itself still lacks the
`02_seed_data.sql` fixture rows these tests (and the pre-existing
`tests/live_db/*.py` suite) depend on — every new test currently fails with
`ForeignKeyViolationError` on `shop_id` when run against the QA branch
directly, confirmed not a code defect (verified the failure mode is
exclusively that one exception class). Run locally against the QA branch
via `TEST_DATABASE_URL` once seeded, or wait for the concurrent effort's PR
to merge.

## 2026-07-16 — Telephony provider: Telnyx → Twilio

**Decision:** Provision Twilio **Estonia (EE) Mobile** numbers as the
Kairo-owned DID for Path 1 (forward) and Path 2 (new) telephony onboarding,
replacing Telnyx Italy local numbers. One Kairo-entity regulatory Bundle,
created once and reused across every shop — no per-salon KYC.

**Why leave Telnyx:** lower onboarding friction was the goal. Turned out
Twilio's Italy catalog has no local/geographic number type at all — only
Mobile at $30/mo — so "provision a mobile number via Twilio" wasn't a
preference, it's the only thing Twilio sells for Italy.

**Why Estonia, not Italy:** the constraint that actually matters for
call-forwarding cost is "within the EU," not "within Italy" — the EU's
intra-member-state calling price cap (capping IT→EU-country calls, vs.
uncapped international rates) applies to any EU member, not just Italy.
Once decoupled from "must be Italian," compared IT/EE/FI/IE/AT/NL/DK:

| Country | Type | Price/mo | KYC address requirement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Italy | Mobile (only option) | $30.00 | anywhere in the world |
| **Estonia** | **Mobile** | **$3.00** | **anywhere in the world** |
| Estonia | Local | $1.00 | anywhere in the world (but not SMS-capable) |
| Finland | Mobile (only option) | $5.00 | must be Finnish (contradicts "no docs" framing) |
| Ireland / Austria / Netherlands | Local | $1-1.60 | must be in-country — new KYC burden, not less |
| Denmark | any type | — | must be Danish for every type — dead end |

Estonia Mobile wins: same friction as Italy Mobile (Kairo's existing Italian
entity docs work directly, no new foreign presence needed), 10x cheaper.

**Why Mobile over Local within Estonia:** Estonia's KYC is identical for
both types (no friction difference), so the deciding factor became SMS
capability — Local numbers aren't SMS-capable in Estonia (true of most EU
geographic ranges), and the plan is to eventually send booking-confirmation
/ opted-in marketing SMS from this number (see below). Local would have
foreclosed that for a $2/mo saving.

**Future SMS/WhatsApp capability (not built yet, deliberately deferred):**
- **Phase 1** (whenever built): send from the raw Twilio number, no
  Alphanumeric Sender ID, salon's name in the message signature/body. Works
  immediately — Italy's Alphanumeric Sender ID pre-registration requirement
  only applies to alphanumeric senders, not plain numeric long codes. Fine
  at small volume (confirmations + ≤10-message opted-in batches) — Italian
  carrier A2P filtering targets bulk/burst campaign patterns, not this.
- **Phase 2** (future, opt-in per shop): a salon can proactively request its
  own registered Alphanumeric Sender ID (its business name as sender).
  Deliberately *not* the default — Twilio confirmed Italy requires
  per-string document registration + carrier vetting for Alphanumeric
  Sender ID, so making every shop's own name the sender would reintroduce
  the per-salon KYC problem this whole design avoids for phone numbers.
- WhatsApp Business messaging is unaffected by any of this — any real
  number can become a WhatsApp sender (Twilio supports voice-OTP
  verification for non-SMS-capable numbers specifically for this case) —
  and is out of scope as its own future feature (Meta business
  verification + template approval, different problem entirely).

**Regulatory bundle model differs from Telnyx's shape:** Telnyx: purchase
first, number goes `pending_review`, webhook flips it active/rejected.
Twilio: the Bundle must be approved *before* a purchase can succeed at all.
Since the Bundle is reused across every DID, that async wait happens once,
at ops setup — not per shop. Every purchase after that is synchronous
(succeeds now or fails outright), so the Telnyx-style async webhook has no
steady-state equivalent and was deleted rather than adapted.

**Implementation notes:**
- The original Twilio client + TwiML webhook existed in this repo before a
  2026-06-06 swap to Telnyx (recoverable from git history at `df9c53a^`) —
  restored and adapted rather than rewritten from scratch.
- Added Twilio `X-Twilio-Signature` request verification — a gap that
  existed under Telnyx too and was never fixed; closed as part of this
  migration rather than carried forward.
- Code review during implementation caught three bugs beyond the original
  plan, all fixed before merge: dead code (`update_telephony_activation`,
  whose only caller was the deleted Telnyx webhook); the provisioned
  `voice_url` was missing its `/api/v1` mount prefix (a bug that predated
  this migration too — every provisioned number's webhook would have 404'd
  in production, so no inbound call would ever have reached the routing
  logic); and `TWILIO_ADDRESS_SID` was read by the provisioning code but
  never wired through CI/deploy-script env vars.

  Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-telnyx-to-twilio-migration.md`.
- Merged into `feat/voice-forwarding-overflow`; local `QA` branch reset to
  match and pushed (force-with-lease) to `origin/QA`.

**Still needed before this is live:** fund/verify the Twilio account, create
and get approval for the one Kairo-entity regulatory Bundle in the Twilio
Console (manual, out-of-band, not automatable from this repo), add the
`TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` / `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` / `TWILIO_BUNDLE_SID` /
`TWILIO_ADDRESS_SID` GitHub repo secrets (replacing the old `TELNYX_*` ones).
